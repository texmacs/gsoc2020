      Improved TeXmacs Converters
    </p>

      <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/soc-projects/ideas-2020.html#texmacs"><tt>https://www.gnu.org/software/soc-projects/ideas-2020.html#texmacs</tt></a>

    <h2 id="auto-3">3<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span>Summary<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h2>
    <p>
      GNU TeXmacs is a free scientific editing platform designed to create
      beautiful technical documents. It also provides options for users to
      convert documental form between TeXmacs document and other forms (eg.
      Html, BibTex, LaTeX). However, with the development of technique and
      documental forms, TeXmacs users need more conversion options for more
      documental forms, which requires contributors to spend much time
      developing new converters from scratches. To optimize this phenomenon,
      the proposal aims to develop a new converter for conversion of markdown
      documents while offering a general framework for converters development.
      On the one hand, markdown converter will appeal more users to use
      TeXmacs; on the other hand, the basic framework helps contributors
      create and write new converters. The proposal lists a detailed
      development timeline as well. This upgrade will make TeXmacs attract
      more contributors to join TeXmacs and develop various converters. In
      addition, this will also bring users more options to import/export and
      appeal to more users who enjoy using Html5, markdown, and other
      documental forms.

          More Powerful Converter
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, users on Internet have various options to choose the document
          to write things, like Jupyter, markdown, MS Office Word, and so on,
          which means the contributor of TeXmacs needs to upgrade the modules
          of conversion to enable TeXmacs to support more documents or file
          format. Not only for better user experience but also for the
          improvement of TeXmacs itself. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Converters now support conversion to/from Html, BibTex, XML, and
          LaTeX while users require conversions to more documents in the
          mainstream, like markdown. So, the development of a markdown
          converter is the first priority. Most websites use markdown to write
          help or comments, like Github, Reddit, Diaspora, SourceForge, and so
          on. This explains why once TeXmacs supports markdown conversion,
          more users will be attracted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, contributors always meet troubles when developing new
          converters one and another from the very beginning. To handle this,
          TeXmacs needs a new, easy-to-use framework for converters. For
          contributors, the framework aims to provide basic functions to
          create new converters and development and save their time reviewing
          other parts of codes; for users, new converters provide them a
          better experience to import/export document forms. TeXmancs also
          needs to prepare some basic tools and frameworks for contributors to
          develop converters based on these.
        </p>
        <p>
          The extension of converters and the development of the framework
          will further empower the current TeXmacs converter functionality and
          improve the quality of TeXmacs.

          More Contributors to the GNU community
        </p>
        <p>
          As a GNU project, TeXmacs need to get more opensource people to
          maintain. A converter framework satisfies contributors who want to
          add more converters in TeXmacs. They use and refer to the basic
          functions that the framework provides, and develop more things to
          empower TeXmacs conversion functionality. My development proposal is
          only a start, and there can be some bugs within the module. But, the
          new contributors attracted by these will possibly join us and help
          maintain the new module, even the whole TeXmacs project. Their
          contribution will make GNU sphere better and attract more people to
          join. In the end, good cycle forms, and the GNU community will be
          larger and stronger.

      <li>
        <p>
          More Users of TeXmacs
        </p>
        <p>
          Better TeXmacs means more users to use our product. Conversion to
          more documental forms is crucial to attracting users. For instance,
          if it is possible for conversion between TeXmacs and markdown,
          TeXmacs will receive a big circle of users since there are thousands
          of people knowing how to write .md. Also, most of the webpage has
          applied Html5, so the extension for Html5 converters will draw the
          attention of plentiful web developers to join TeXmacs. The above all
          explain why TeXmacs need more powerful converters. So the join of
          more contributors will bring TeXmacs more converters, which helps
          TeXmacs receive more users.

          Front End - the Place to Show Conversion Options
        </p>
        <p>
          The framework should make contributors think less about minor code
          and pay more attention to the algorithm part - the conversion part.
          So the converter framework needs to help contributors firstly create
          Front-End items automatically. To achieve this, I need to figure out
          where the conversion options are presented in TeXmacs, and what
          codes produce them.

        <p>
          There are mainly two steps to locate the Front-End part.
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, it is important for any developer to locate where
          users can experience new features at the interface, which is also
          imperative for inverse engineering. TeXmacs shows conversion options
          as <tt class="verbatim">File-&gt;Import/Export-&gt;[File Type]</tt> in
          <b>Figure 1</b>. So the ultimate objective is to add
          &ldquo;Markdown&rdquo; or other documental form items in submenus of
          Import and Export options. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, locating the source code of front-end view. The front-end
          codes are at <tt class="verbatim">$TEXMACS_PATH/TeXmacs/progs/texmacs/menus/file-menu.scm</tt>.
          
        </p>
        <p>
          Line 236~238 shows &ldquo;Import&rdquo; and &ldquo;Export&rdquo;
          options. And line 108~131 shows submenus, the dynamic options of
          conversion. We can see these words match what shows in the user-end
          view. The Scheme codes were written well there, and it is possible
          for me to figure out the important class within the critical parts. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After getting familiar with them, I can follow the codes written
          before and link up the front-end modification with framework codes
          in a short period of time. Still, compilation and testing work is in
          need and may cost a lot of time.

          Back-End - How Contributors Write New Converters
        </p>
        <p>
          To further help contributors focus on algorithm part of converters,
          I need to learn the procedures to write a converter in the Back-End
          part and try to extend converters. Since markdown and Html5 prevail
          in communities, I choose to write these two converters as a trial.
          Also, I do this for the improvement of current converters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, to write the core parts of the converter is just the
          same as writing a function - declare and implement. TeXmacs offers
          friendly ways to declare converters and data formats (<a href="http://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/manual/webman-convert.en.html"><tt>http://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/manual/webman-convert.en.html</tt></a>)
          with high abstraction as follows:
        </p>
        <pre class="verbatim" xml:space="preserve">
(define-format <i>format</i>
  (:name <i>format-name</i>)
  <i>options</i>)
(converter <i>from-format-name to-format-name</i>
  <i>options</i>)</pre>
        <p>
          Moreover, we can see example in <tt class="verbatim">$/TEXMACS_PATH/progs/convert/init-html.scm</tt>.
          This directory shows how converter converts TeXmacs doc to Html. We
          can locate declaration of &ldquo;Html&rdquo; format (line 36) and
          converter from &ldquo;texmacs-stree&rdquo; to several html-related
          data formats (line 48~68). 
        </p>
        <p>
          So, in the same way, I can declare a new converter in a new
          directory with <tt class="verbatim">init-xxx.scm</tt>. The more important
          matter is to implement the conversion.

              Markdown converter
            </p>
            <p>
              The <b>first task</b> of the proposal is to import a fresh new
              markdown converter to TeXmacs. Mere transplanting converter
              module is not that hard though, more important thing is to
              verify whether or not the converter can process conversion
              perfectly. So, my core works are as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Module Transplant
                </p>
                <p>
                  Contributors of TeXmacs have published a markdown converter.
                  (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/mdbenito/tm2md/src/master/"><tt>https://bitbucket.org/mdbenito/tm2md/src/master/</tt></a>).
                  So, I just need to transplant the module into the TeXmacs
                  code instead of developing markdown converters from
                  scratches. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Transplanting seems easy enough though, I shall not only
                  transplant source code of the markdown converter but also
                  display markdown converter options in the user interface.
                  Besides coding, basic testing and verification are also in
                  need.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition, thanks to the existence of the markdown
                  converter, I can also focus on developing general converter
                  frameworks to help more contributors transplant their
                  converters into TeXmacs, just like what I do.

                  Conversion Bug Fixing
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another problem is how to verify the functionality of the
                  markdown converter. Transplanting not means everything is
                  fine, on the contrary, it will possibly bring more bugs and
                  errors to the project. Also, users want a perfect converter,
                  not a semi-manufacture. The best way to find bugs is to use
                  a TeXmacs document as a testing sample and make it be
                  converted to markdown format as perfect as possible. Bugs
                  like some text cannot be converted successfully can be
                  found, and then it is my task to fix this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ultimate goal is to make the converter supporting
                  &ldquo;perfect conversion&rdquo; for
                  &ldquo;markdown-to-TeXmacs&rdquo; and
                  &ldquo;TeXmacs-to-markdown&rdquo;.

              Html5 converter
            </p>
            <p>
              Since TeXmacs contains a converter for Html, contributors can
              follow the development of the Html converter and figure out
              differences between Html and Html5. Clarifying what they need to
              develop is important because some features that TeXmacs does not
              support or does not need (for instance, Html5 includes more
              features regarding multi-media though, TeXmacs document does not
              need those features). 
            </p>
            <p>
              Some details of Html5 v.s. Html features are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Html5 has lots of new semantic tags: &lt;article&gt;
                  &lt;header&gt; &lt;nav&gt; &hellip;
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Html's tags are most of the low semantics.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Html5 abandons some of Html tags.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Html5 differs in doctype declaration from Html
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>

            <p>
              Other converters
            </p>
            <p>
              As for other converters in general, it is up to contributors to
              implement. The development of the converter framework should
              give them a good environment to write a core conversion
              algorithm. Generally, I think there are two ways to implement
              the conversion.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, direct implementation. In this way, contributors need to
              find the public part of TeXmacs and Office formats and exclude
              other meaningless parts. Then, they should write a conversion
              process between two encoding formats. Since the TeXmacs document
              is content-limited and simple, the conversion is possible to
              make.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, indirect implementation. This means contributors need
              open-source solutions - to include a third-party module in
              TeXmacs's code. And the module needs to process the conversion
              itself. For example, a &ldquo;TeXmacs to Office doc&rdquo;
              process can be performed by &ldquo;pandoc&rdquo; as
              &ldquo;TeXmacs to markdown, and markdown to Office doc&rdquo;.
              This way is more possible but needs to be careful about the
              interest of developers.

          Framework Development
        </p>
        <p>
          After finish getting familiar with Front-End and Back-End codes
          about converters while finish developing markdown converter, the
          <b>second task</b> is to develop the converter framework. The above
          analysis show several features the framework should support as
          follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Front-End: add conversion options in TeXmacs automatically after
              contributors declare new converters. This part should be an
              abstraction to contributors unless they want to modify this.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Back-End: give contributors some fixed declarations and methods
              for writing converters, and let them write the core code of
              algorithm without worrying about other things. This part should
              also provide documents and standards to guide contributors to
              develop their converters legally.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Assume contributors finished converter development already, they
              need to test new features to evaluate. The feedback of users is
              important to give directions for further development. TeXmacs
              project has some Google test samples and testing code (<a href="https://github.com/texmacs/texmacs/tree/master/tests"><tt>https://github.com/texmacs/texmacs/tree/master/tests</tt></a>).
              I can add merge these codes to the framework as a testing part.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Following the above steps can still meet with new ideas and annoying
          bugs, so I need to develop functions in iterations.

          Document Writing
        </p>
        <p>
          After framework development is completed, I need to update the
          official document (<a href="webman-convert.en.html"><tt>webman-convert.en.html</tt></a>) to
          show that TeXmacs includes a converter framework. Additionally, a
          summary of my development is nice to have. My experience of writing
          papers and documents can help me in this part.

      In the upcoming period of time and summer, I will first go to Jiangsu,
      China, to get my graduation certificate, and go back to Shandong, China,
      my hometown. During this time, I can absorb in development without
      dealing with other things. Also, I will choose to use <b>Zoom</b> with
      mentors to communicate face-to-face. Using the <b>dev-mail list</b>,
      <b>email</b> or <b>Gitter</b> is also helpful. We may live in a
      different time zone, so make an appointment before start communication
      is necessary.

    <p>
      As a senior student in the Computer Science department, I have been
      working with my friend to develop lots of team projects. They are great
      though, I found that I have been merely making toy programs in
      university and only have limited experience of developing real
      industrial projects. So a real, full-stack development experience is
      important to me, not to mention that it is what I need to become a
      high-caliber developer and software specialist in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      GSoC provides me a good chance to work with great mentors to maintain
      open-source projects. I choose to improve TeXmacs because it is close to
      my academic life and the product can improve my writing experience.
      Also, I have some experience developing user-oriented products. I think
      my code-decoupling ability, solid coding ability, paper writing skill,
      and persistence will help TeXmacs become better. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope to join the GNU community and try the best of mine to make
      TeXmacs greater!
